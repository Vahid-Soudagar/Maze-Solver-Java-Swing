### Maze Solver in Java with Swing

This repository contains a Java-based Maze Solver application developed using Java Swing. The project consists of two classes, `MazeSolver` and `DepthFirst`, which work together to visualize and solve a maze.

### Project Features:

- **Maze Visualization:** The `MazeSolver` class provides a graphical interface for visualizing the maze. It displays walls, open paths, the destination, and the solution path.

- **Depth-First Search Algorithm:** The `DepthFirst` class contains a depth-first search algorithm that searches for a path from a start point to the destination in the maze.

- **User Interface:** The graphical user interface allows users to see the maze, the path being explored, and the final solution.

- **Customizable:** You can modify the maze by changing the values in the 2D array to create different maze configurations.
